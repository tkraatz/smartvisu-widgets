This is a set of additional general purpose widgets. Some are new while others are derived from SmartVISU and have additional features.

Currently:
  * multistate: A button to display a state (similar to 'dual'). When clicked a popup appears allowing to switch to another state
  * flip: Derived from basic.flip but allows configure the values that are interpreted as 'on' and 'off'
